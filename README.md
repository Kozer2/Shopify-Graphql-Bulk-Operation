# Shopify-Graphql-Bulk-Operation
This project was made to gather customer data from the Shopify API. Including the Customer ID field. 
Due to the way the Shopify API limits calls to 250 per request, large store sizes need a way to gather more data. This project uses a Graphql POST request to gather data on all a stores customers.
